**Description**

The Line-Line Intersection Calculator is a web application developed using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS that allows users to find the point of intersection between two lines in a 2D Cartesian coordinate system. This tool is useful for various applications in geometry, computer graphics, and mathematics.

The calculator takes as input the coordinates of the endpoints of each line and calculates the intersection point, if it exists. It supports both vertical and horizontal lines, as well as inclined lines.

**Features**

- Find the intersection point between two lines.
- Support for vertical, horizontal, and inclined lines.
- Simple and easy-to-use interface.
- Responsive design, ensuring optimal user experience across devices and screen sizes.


**How to Use**

1. Input: Enter the coordinates of the endpoints of Line 1 and Line 2 in the provided input fields using the sliders.
2. Output: The calculator will display the coordinates of the intersection point (if it exists) on the screen alongside the line equation in parametric form.

**Compatibility**

The Line-Line Intersection Calculator is designed to be responsive, meaning it adapts to various screen sizes and devices. Whether you are using a desktop computer, laptop, tablet, or smartphone, the calculator will provide an optimal user experience.

**Technologies Used**

The calculator is built using the following technologies:

HTML: The structure and layout of the web page.
CSS: Styling and design elements to enhance the visual appearance.
